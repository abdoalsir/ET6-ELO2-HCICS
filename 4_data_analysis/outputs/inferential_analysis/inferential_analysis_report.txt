1. SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moran's I Statistic: 0.4918
Expected Value (random): -0.0056
Z-score: 11.0254
P-value: 0.0010

FINDING: Significant positive spatial autocorrelation detected.
INTERPRETATION: High-vulnerability localities cluster geographically.
IMPLICATION: Targeted regional interventions are appropriate.


2. PREDICTIVE MODELING RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Random Forest Accuracy: 0.946
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.946

Top 5 Predictive Features:
  - idp_burden_score: 0.3841
  - origin_intensity_score: 0.3476
  - facility_access_score: 0.2683

FINDING: Machine learning models successfully predict risk categories.
IMPLICATION: The vulnerability scoring methodology is statistically valid.


3. HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 1: Darfur vs. Non-Darfur Comparison (t-test)
  Darfur mean vulnerability: 31.90
  Non-Darfur mean vulnerability: 42.33
  P-value: 0.0000
  RESULT: Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)
Test 2: Multi-Regional ANOVA
  F-statistic: 18.5666
  P-value: 0.0000
  RESULT: Significant differences exist between regions.

Test 3: Chi-Square Test (Risk Distribution)
  Chi-square statistic: 22.0797
  P-value: 0.0000
  RESULT: Risk distribution differs significantly by region.


4. KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

VALIDATED FINDINGS:
• The vulnerability assessment methodology is statistically robust
• Machine learning models achieve 94.6% prediction accuracy
• IDP population and facility access are primary vulnerability drivers
• Crisis zones exhibit significant geographic clustering
• Darfur region shows statistically distinct crisis patterns

IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE:
• Data-driven targeting of resources is empirically justified
• Regional coordination should focus on identified clusters
• Facility accessibility is a critical intervention point
• Early warning systems should monitor top predictive features
