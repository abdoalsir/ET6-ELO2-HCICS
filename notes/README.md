# Notes

The data collection phase (milestone 2) of the project has been slightly delayed
past the November 4th deadline. The delay was due to an unsuccessful attempt to
acquire more granular Administrative Level 3 (Admin3) data from the
International Organization for Migration (IOM), which would have significantly
enhanced the resolution of the final analysis. The lack of a response from IOM
impacted the timeline for data collection, preparation, and initial exploration.

I did not use GitHub Issues or Pull Requests in this repository because I am
working alone. All changes were made directly in the main branch.

## Note on Python Formatting for Notebooks

**Change:**
Excluded Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) from the Ruff formatting check in CI.

**Reason:**
Ruff does not natively support `.ipynb` files. Running Ruff on notebooks causes
formatting checks to fail.

## Note of Data Analysis

Milestone 3 missed the planned Novermber 18th deadline because the documentation
took longer than expected
