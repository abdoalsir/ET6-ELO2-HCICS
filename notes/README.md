# Notes

The data collection phase (milestone 2) of the project has been slightly delayed
past the November 4th deadline. The delay was due to an unsuccessful attempt to
acquire more granular Administrative Level 3 (Admin3) data from the
International Organization for Migration (IOM), which would have significantly
enhanced the resolution of the final analysis. The lack of a response from IOM
impacted the timeline for data collection, preparation, and initial exploration.
