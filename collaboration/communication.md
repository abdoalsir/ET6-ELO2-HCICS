## Asking for Help (30/60 Rule)

Managing roadblocks efficiently is essential for maintaining project progress.
The following escalation plan ensures that I use available resources
effectively:

1. **0 → 30 min:** Attempt to resolve the issue independently through
documentation, debugging, or research.
2. **30 → 60 min:** Reach out to **fellow learners or mentors** via Slack for
quick advice.
3. **60+ min:** **Tag program coaches** in Slack or open a detailed
**GitHub Issue** outlining the problem and attempted solutions.
