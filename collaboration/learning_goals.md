# Learning Goals

This project represents the culmination of my participation in the
**MIT Emerging Talent Program**.
Through the development of the **Humanitarian Crisis Intelligence and
Communication System (HCICS)** MVP,
I aim to integrate technical, analytical, and communication skills to produce a
tangible humanitarian data science solution.
My learning goals below follow the **SMART framework**, ensuring they are
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

## Personal Learning Goals

1. **Portfolio Development (Specific & Measurable):**
   Complete a functional **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of the HCICS and
   upload all code, analysis notebooks, and documentation to a public GitHub
   repository by the end of the MIT ET program (**December 2025**).

2. **Career Support (Relevant):**
   Utilize the completed HCICS project as the **primary portfolio piece** in
   applications for data science master's programs beginning in **2026**,
   demonstrating my capacity to apply data science for humanitarian challenges.

3. **Technical Mastery (Achievable):**
   Strengthen my technical foundation in **data fusion**,
   **geospatial analysis**, and **dashboard development** through practical
   implementation during the HCICS MVP development phase
   (**Septemberâ€“December 2025**).

4. **Real-World Impact (Relevant):**
   Prepare a comprehensive, non-technical presentation of the HCICS MVP and its
   benefits, and present it to the **Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health**
   after the MVP completion, by **early 2026**.

5. **Engagement & Feedback (Timely):**
   Actively engage with **mentors, program coaches, and humanitarian
   professionals** to gain continuous feedback and ensure that my project
   maintains real-world relevance and technical integrity.
