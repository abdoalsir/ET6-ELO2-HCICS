# Humanitarian Crisis Intelligence and Communication System (HCICS) ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©

## Project Overview

The **Humanitarian Crisis Intelligence and Communication System (HCICS)** is a
data-driven framework designed to address the catastrophic public health
information breakdown in **Sudan** following the ongoing conflict and
humanitarian crisis. The systemâ€™s core mission is to transform fragmented data
from disparate sourcesâ€”such as humanitarian reports and geospatial
informationâ€”into **actionable intelligence** for public health
decision-makers. This is necessary because the crisis has created an
unprecedented public health emergency characterized by a devastated health
system, mass displacement, and significant disease outbreaks.

The project directly supports the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health's need for
a tool that enables a shift from a reactive to an **adaptive posture** in
crisis response, thereby strengthening public health resilience.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Objectives

As the graduation project for the MIT Emerging Talent Program, this repository
focuses on the development of a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**, which will
serve as a **proof-of-concept** for the full HCICS system. The MVP is designed
to establish the core data pipeline and a basic visualization platform.

### MVP Components & Value

**1. Data Aggregation Engine**
:   **Functionality:** The foundation for collecting, cleaning, and **fusing**
    structured humanitarian and geospatial data (IOM DTM, HOT OSM). It
    establishes API connections and performs initial data transformation.
:   **Strategic Value:** Creates a **"single source of truth"** from multiple,
    unreliable, and fragmented data streams, addressing data interoperability.

**2. Crisis Analysis Core (MVP Level)**
:   **Functionality:** Applying **geospatial analysis** to combine the fused
    data. The core task is to calculate the spatial relationship between
    population centers (IDPs) and health services.
:   **Strategic Value:** Identifies and analyzes **"maps of vulnerability"** by
    correlating locations of displaced populations with the availability of
    health facilities.

**3. Communication & Dissemination Platform**
:   **Functionality:** A public-facing, web-based dashboard for visualizing key
    indicators. The MVP focuses on interactive maps and data visualization.
:   **Strategic Value:** Translates complex data into easily digestible,
    **actionable insights** for resource allocation and public health awareness.

## Core Data Sources (MVP)

The MVP will integrate and analyze the following key open-source data streams:

* **IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Data**: Provides information on the
    number, location, and movement of **internally displaced persons (IDPs)**.
    This data is typically available via API.
* **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Data**: Provides geospatial data on
    the locations and types of **health facilities** (e.g., 'hospital',
    'clinic').

## Technology Stack (Anticipated)

* **Data Processing:** Python, Pandas, ETL Scripts
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Python (e.g., GeoPandas, Folium, Shapely)
* **Visualization/Dashboard:** Streamlit or Dash (for interactive web
    presentation)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Project Milestones and Timeline

This project is aligned with the MIT ET Program's **Capstone Project
Deliverables** (ELO2 Track 2), following the standard CDSP milestone structure.
All milestones are expected to be completed and tagged in this repository.

* **Milestone 0 (October 7th):** **Cross-Cultural Collaboration & Setup:**
    Prepare the repository and project board for open-source contribution.
* **Milestone 1 (October 21st):** **Problem Identification:** Conduct the
    initial domain study and **frame an actionable research question(s)**.
* **Milestone 2 (November 4th):** **Data Collection:** Decide on the data model,
    determine relevant data (IOM DTM, HOT OSM), and then **collect, clean,
    document, and host the data set**.
* **Milestone 3 (November 18th):** **Data Analysis:** Focus on the appropriate
    analysis techniques (Geospatial Analysis) and producing the **results from
    your analysis** with a non-technical summary.
* **Milestone 4 (December 2nd):** **Communicating Results:** Translate findings
    into a clear message and **prepare a communication strategy and
    artifact(s)** (the MVP dashboard) to reach the defined target audience.
* **Milestone 5 (TBD):** **Final Presentation:** Prepare a 2.5-minute
    presentation covering the communication artifact, project evolution,
    learnings, and next steps.

## Ethical Framework and Data Governance

Given the sensitivity of working with humanitarian data concerning vulnerable
displaced populations, the HCICS is built on a strong ethical foundation.

* **Data Protection**: The system requires security measures to protect the
    privacy of individuals. A **Data Protection Impact Assessment** would be
    conducted to mitigate potential risks associated with data handling.
* **Bias and Misinterpretation**: The use of geospatial correlation and
    open-source data can introduce biases. The design incorporates a
    **human-in-the-loop validation process** to ensure analysis is robust and
    recommendations are carefully considered before being acted upon.
* **Transparency and Accountability**: The HCICS is intended to operate with a
    high degree of transparency to ensure the Ministry of Health and
    humanitarian partners are accountable for data-driven decisions.

## Future Expansion (Post-MVP)

The HCICS is designed to be scalable. Future expansion phases will integrate the
features deferred from the MVP to build a national-scale solution:

* **Unstructured Data Analysis**: Integration of social media feeds for
    **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, sentiment analysis, and
    **"rumor tracking"** to counter misinformation (the "infodemic").
* **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracking population movements and disease outbreaks
    over time to identify trends and anticipate future resource needs.
